Matt's Jubilant Pancake
--------------------
This fork was created by Matt Thorry for Success Academy Charter Schools and fulfills the requirements listed below. It was created using JavaScript with React on the frontend and Node/Express on the backend. All CSS and styling are done by me and made to match the SA aesthetic.

To install and run,

1. Clone this repo
2. Change directories into server and run command `npm install && npm start` to start the backend Node server
3. Then change directories into client and run command `npm install && npm start` to start the frontend React server
4. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/
5. Enjoy and thank you for your time! I look forward to your feedback.


The Jubilant Pancake
--------------------
We would like to see a front end page that contains a two textfield form which when submitted
sends two strings to a backend service. The backend service computes the edit distance between two strings
(returns the minimum number of operations required to transform one string into another). The computed output
is then returned to the end user.

Assignment Instructions
-----------------------
Fork this repo and when you are done with the assignment submit a pull request. Write an email (with url to the pull request included) to our HR
indicating you are done and the solution is ready for code review.)


Constraints
-----------
You must meet the following constraints in order for the project to be
considered valid:

#. No page reload / Single-page App
#. JSON dependent on both ends
#. A server side component in the language of your choosing (ranked preference: Python, JavaScript, anything else)
#. Do not use third-party libaries to compute the edit distance

Scoring
-------
Your code will be judged based on the following scoring system:

#. How well you've styled and used HTML/CSS on the frontend pages
#. How well the project is tested
#. How well structured your commits are
#. How well documented your code is
#. If using Python, how close your Python code adheres to PEP8 and PyLint ideals
