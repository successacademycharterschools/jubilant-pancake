The Jubilant Pancake
--------------------
We would like to see a front end page that contains a two textfield form which when submitted
sends two strings to a backend service. The backend service computes the edit distance between two string
(returns the minimum number of operations required to transform one string into another). The computed output
is then returned to the end user.
